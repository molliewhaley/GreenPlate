## GreenPlate

### Description 
Looking to explore the world of plant based cuisine? GreenPlate is for all of the veggie-lovers out there! Whether you’re a seasoned vegan or just starting out, this app is the perfect companion for all things vegan. 

### Inspiration 
This app stems from my own plant-based journey. I’ve been plant based for most of my life and finding yummy (and vegan!) foods has sometimes been difficult. Trying to grocery shop, prepare meals, and find restaurants on vacations has cost me a lot of time on online. I decided to create this app to quickly find vegan accomodations regardless of the scenario, so I could spend more time enjoying and less time Googling.
